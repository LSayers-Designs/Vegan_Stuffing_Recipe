# Vegan_Stuffing_Recipe
One of my first original practice web pages I created using one of my favorite recipes for Thanksgiving.  Star if you like the recipe.   ^_^
It was just before Thanksgiving and I wanted to use what I learned from the HTML and CSS modules in my web development course.   
Since I love cooking and my friends always ask me to write down my recipes, I decided to start by creating this mini web page just in time 
for Thanksgiving.  
Give me a star if you liked it!  If you would like to see more, follow me here on Github.  ^_^
